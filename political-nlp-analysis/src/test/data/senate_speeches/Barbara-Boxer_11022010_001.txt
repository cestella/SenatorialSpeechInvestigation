U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (both D-CA) today congratulated the San Francisco Giants on defeating the Texas Rangers to become World Series Champions.
Senator Boxer said, “I am so pleased to join millions of other baseball fans in California in congratulating the San Francisco Giants on becoming World Series Champions. Their historic season has brought great pride to San Francisco and to our state, and their determination and teamwork have made them the best in baseball.” 

“This is a tremendous victory for the Giants and for San Francisco,” Senator Feinstein said. “This was a team of underdogs. There are few big names, and they’ve been called misfits and rejects. Edgar Renteria was plagued by injuries and sat on the bench for a good part of the season. But he rose to the occasion, delivered the game-winning home run and became the World Series MVP."  

“The Giants showed what teamwork can do and they brought the city together. Being in San Francisco on the night the Giants won the World Series was special -- people of all ages, all races, all incomes, coming together in sheer joy. I am so proud of the Giants, and so proud of San Francisco.”
