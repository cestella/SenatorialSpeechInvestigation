Upon release of the National Research Council’s study on the new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility to be built in Manhattan, the entire Kansas Congressional Delegation released the following statement:
 
“The Department of Homeland Security has chosen Manhattan as the site for the new NBAF. The construction of this cutting edge facility must move forward to safely conduct critical research to protect our nation’s agriculture sector and food supply. The National Research Council’s study is helpful to DHS as it continues in its design phase of the NBAF facility. We are also pleased that it confirms the importance of building a new NBAF to protect our nation. However, we are concerned that some of the findings do not seem to account for mitigation and safety plans that DHS has already said will be put in place. These efforts should not be discounted. We are confident this facility will be the safest research laboratory in the world and its mission is critical in order to protect our nation’s food supply.”
 
The statement was released by U.S. Senators Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback, Representatives Lynn Jenkins, Jerry Moran, Dennis Moore and Todd Tiahrt.
