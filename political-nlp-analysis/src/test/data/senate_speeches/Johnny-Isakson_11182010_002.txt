U.S. Senators Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today urged Georgia motorists to drive safely during the holiday season, particularly on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. A resolution they authored to designate Sunday, Nov. 28, 2010, as "Drive Safer Sunday" was approved by the Senate in September. 

Statistics show that the Sunday after Thanksgiving is the busiest highway traffic day of the year. The high volume of vehicles on America's highways and interstates increases the risk for dangerous or fatal accidents. The "Drive Safer Sunday" resolution encourages motorists, trucking firms and law enforcement agencies to work together to make the roads safer for all travelers during the holidays and throughout the year.

"We must do a better job of educating all drivers to be safer on the road, and I am proud to join with Senator Chambliss to designate one of the biggest travel days of the year as 'Drive Safer Sunday,' " Isakson said.

"As a father and a grandfather, I share the concern families have when their loved ones are traveling on the road," said Chambliss. "It is my hope that this resolution will serve as a reminder to all those traveling during the Thanksgiving holidays, and all year long, to be safe, vigilant and alert."

Isakson and Chambliss have introduced similar resolutions in the previous years in honor of Cullum Owings, a Georgia college student who died in a traffic accident on his way back to school after Thanksgiving 2002. Cullum Owings' parents, Steve and Susan Owings of Atlanta, founded an organization called Road Safe America in honor of their son to bring awareness of the hazards of highway travel and provide statistics and safety tips to drivers. Its goals include better driver training for all drivers and limiting the top speed for large trucks.
